# Web3 Auction DApp - README

Welcome to the **Web3 Auction DApp** project repository! This decentralized application (DApp) leverages blockchain technology to implement an auction platform on the Ethereum network. Participants can place bids on items of interest, and the highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the item.

## Overview

The **Web3 Auction DApp** provides a user-friendly interface to participate in Ethereum-based auctions. This project ensures transparency and trust in the auction process through the use of smart contracts. Users can place bids, monitor ongoing auctions, and claim their winnings seamlessly.

## Features

- Browse ongoing auctions.
- Place bids on items of interest.
- Automatic outbidding: The system places slightly higher bids on behalf of users when they're outbid.
- Real-time updates: Receive instant notifications for outbids and auction end events.
- Claiming winnings: Winners of auctions can easily claim their items.
- Ethereum Wallet Integration: Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to participate directly.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally and start participating in web3 auctions.

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Rise-In/XXX-Bootcamp-FinalCase.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
  cd XXX-Bootcamp-FinalCase
```

3. Install required npm packages:

```bash
 npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

```bash
 npm start
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the DApp.

3. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the DApp.

4. Browse ongoing auctions, place bids, and monitor your auction activity.

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts in this project facilitate the auction process. They handle bids, auction creation, and winner determination. These contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

- `AuctionFactory.sol`: Responsible for creating new auctions.
- `Auction.sol`: Manages bidding and winner determination for individual auctions.

## Testing

Smart contract tests are located in the `test` folder. These tests ensure the correct functioning of the smart contract. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to execute the tests:

```bash
truffle test
```

This command will initiate the smart contract tests and display the results in the terminal.

## Frontend

The DApp frontend is built using modern web technologies including React.js. It provides an intuitive and interactive user interface for auction participation.

- **React.js**: Powers the DApp's user interface.
- **Web3.js**: The Ethereum JavaScript API for smart contract interaction.
- **MetaMask**: A popular Ethereum wallet browser extension for secure transactions.
